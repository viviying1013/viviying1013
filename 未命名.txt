A
particularly successful design for semiconducting donor
polymers has been to incorporate both electron donating and
accepting monomers into the polymer backbone.8−10 When an
electron donating monomer is copolymerized with an electron
accepting monomer, the orbitals mix resulting in hybridized polymer molecular orbitals, where the polymer LUMO (lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital) orbital is characteristic of the
acceptor unit LUMO and the polymer HOMO (highest
occupied molecular orbital) level is characteristic of the donor
unit HOMO
